# Simple text translation bot

Welcome to my AI agent Project! This is a AI agent built to engage with users which will help them to write efficient python code without having any prior python knowledge. This AI can be customized according to your needs and preferences only for python code.

This agent can have errors and glitches as it is just a prototype project. So, sorry for any inconvience caused.

## Installation and Dependencise
  1. Make a virtual env in python 
```bash
  python -m venv <env-name>
```
  2. Install agno and groq library
```bash
  <env-name>/bin/pip install agno groq requests    python-dotenv
```
  3. Sign in to groq website and access thier api-key and make a .env file and store the key in .env file
```bash
  GROQ_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
```
  4. To run the file in your local machine
```bash
  python3 file-name.py
```
## Lessons Learned

I have learned how to make AI agents using the agno framework and GROQ api for models. This project encouraged me for doing more such projects in future.
